## üíª Developing habitcentric services

Depending on your personal preference, you can either develop against mock services or develop
against the real thing. The mock services are implemented using [wiremock](http://wiremock.org/).

Some services **require** a local postgres instance as well.
The mock services and postgres instance can be started up using the provided `docker-compose.yaml`
inside of the service directory.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è You can not start the mock services and the real services simultaneously because they bind to
> the same port.
> This is by design, so mock services and real services can be used interchangeably.

All JVM-based services are set up as a Gradle project and can be run using the provided Gradle
wrapper as long as you have a JDK 11 present on your machine.

#### Example: Starting report service using mock services

```shell
# change into report service directory
cd ./services/report

# start mock services
docker-compose up -d habit track

# start report service
./gradlew bootRun
```

#### Example: Start report service using real habit and track service

```shell
# change into habit service directory
cd ./services/habit

# start local postgres instance for habit service
docker-compose up -d db

# start habit service
./gradlew bootRun

# change into track service directory
cd ../track

# start local postgres instance for track service
docker-compose up -d db

# start track service
./gradlew bootRun

# change into report service directory
cd ../report

# run report service
./gradlew bootRun
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è If your IDE supports starting Spring Boot applications directly, you can use your IDEs run
> configuration as well.

All other services (currently only `auth-keycloak`) can be started using the provided
`docker-compose.yml` file.
They are configured to build the container image locally, so make sure to provide the `--build`
option to re-build the container.

```shell
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### Code Style Conventions

#### General

We provide an [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) configuration inside the root folder of this
repository.
This config defines some general rules like indent size, indent style etc.
Please make sure that your IDE respects `.editorconfig` files.

#### Java

We use the [Google Java Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) to format Java
source code.
All Gradle projects include a [Spotless plugin](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless) configuration
you can use to format the code before commiting it.

```shell
./gradlew spotlessJavaApply
```

> Google also provides a CLI and integrations for IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse and VS Code.
> See https://github.com/google/google-java-format.

#### Kotlin

We use the default IntelliJ Kotlin code style.
There are currently no tools configured to enforce code style rules outside of IntelliJ.

### Container & Helm Charts

Dockerfiles and Helm charts are maintained in the service directories, either directly in the root
directory in case of the `Dockerfile` or a dedicated `helm` directory for the corresponding Helm
charts.

Container images are published using Docker Hub while Helm charts are currently only available
for local use.

## üîå Infrastructure Configurations

All infrastructure configurations, like deployment configurations for different deployment targets
or service mesh config files are stored in the `infrastructure` directory.

The goal is to provide infrastructure configurations which...

- ... provide a good out-of-the-box experience, i.e. can be applied from scratch without much issues
- ... are easily destroyable, i.e. all deployments can be removed entirely with a single command

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è This is one of the reasons why we do not utilize or showcase any Kubernetes operators.
> Operators need time to destroy deployments before they are destroyed themselves.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Pipeline

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This section is work in progress due to our GitHub migration.

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Miscellaneous Stuff

### Service Port Configuration

Each habitcentric service runs with the same ports across all deployment options.

| Service           | Port  |
|-------------------|-------|
| gateway           | 9000  |
| habit             | 9001  |
| habit-postgres    | 10001 |
| track             | 9002  |
| track-postgres    | 10002 |
| report            | 9003  |
| ui                | 9004  |
| keycloak          | 8080  |
| keycloak-postgres | 10003 |
